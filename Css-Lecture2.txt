        Sun : The sun is a huge ball of gases. It has a diameter of 1,392,000 km. It is so huge that it can hold
        millions of planets inside it. The Sun is mainly made up of hydrogen and helium gas. The surface of the Sun is
        known as the photosphere. The photosphere is surrounded by a thin layer of gas known as the chromospheres.
        Without the Sun, there would be no life on Earth. There would be no plants, no animals and no human beings. As,
        all the living things on Earth get their energy from the Sun for their survival.

        Haryanaand Uttar Pradesh. It has some of the famous buildings and monuments such as the Qutub Minar, Reu Fort,

        the Parliament House, the Central Secretariat and the famous Connaught place. Delhi is a beautiful city. But, it
        is becoming very crowded and polluted. I love Delhi a lot.

        Hawker : A hawker is a person who moves from one place to another and sell their goods, by shouting on the
        streets. They work hard throughout the day. They move on the street on their bicycle and sometimes on foot and
        sell their products. We can see hawkers everywhere. They move everywhere selling their goods without caring
        about the weather. There is a hawker who sells vegetables on his bicycle in our locality. His name is Manoj. He
        brings fresh vegetables at a very reasonable price. He is a nice and an honest hawker.

        A Snake Charmer : A snake charmer is a person who moves the streets with different types of the banks of the
        river Yamuna. It is snakes in his basket. He goes from one place to another to show various types of snakes and
        their
        tricks. He carries a pipe with which he plays music and snakes dance to his tune. He usually wears a colourful
        dress. The job of a snake charmer is quite dangerous. Some snakes are quite poisonous and can even bite him. It
        is not an easy task to catch and train them for the shows.
