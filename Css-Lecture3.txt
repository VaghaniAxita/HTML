                Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December
                25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world.<br /> A feast central
                to the liturgical year in Christianity, it follows the season of Advent (which begins four Sundays
                before) or the Nativity Fast, and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West
                lasts  twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night.<br /> Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries,
                is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as culturally by many non-Christians,
                and forms an integral part of the holiday season surrounding it.
